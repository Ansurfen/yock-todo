# Yock TODO

English | [简体中文](./docs/zh_cn/README.md)

Yock-Todo stores the static resources necessary for yock to run, such as ypm's modules, configuration files required in the module, etc. Yoch-Todo has a lot of mirrors (Gitlab, Gitee) and they all serve as alternate node/mirror sources. `NOTE`: If you contribute to Yock-Todo, please unify the PR to the main Github repository.
